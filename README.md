## Our Game
Three Progressive Scenes:

Scene 1 – Classic Invasion: Enemies descend in waves while starfields scroll in the background. Power-ups appear randomly based on a CSV-driven spawn system.

Scene 2 – Zig-Zag Blitz: Aliens swarm in a zigzag formation, intensifying the challenge. Speed and MultiShot power-ups appear mid-battle to aid survival.

Scene 3 – Boss Battle: The final scene pits you against a powerful boss with projectile attacks and a dramatic showdown.

Power-Ups (Level-Based):

Speed Up: Increases your ship's movement speed in 4 stages (default to max).

MultiShot: Enhances your shooting ability — from a single bullet to up to 4 bullets per shot. Each collected power-up adds +1 bullet.
